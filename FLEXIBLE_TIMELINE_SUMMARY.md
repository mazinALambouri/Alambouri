# ✅ Flexible Timeline Layout - Complete!

## What Changed

I've restored the **timeline layout** with flexible ordering and added **time category badges** to each place.

## Timeline Layout Features

### Visual Design
- **Numbered sequence** (1, 2, 3...) in red circles
- **Vertical dashed line** connecting places chronologically
- **Color-coded badges** showing the type of each place:
  - 🌅 **Breakfast** (Orange)
  - 🏛️ **Visit** (Blue)
  - 🕌 **Prayer** (Purple)
  - 🍽️ **Lunch** (Green)
  - ⚡ **Activity** (Yellow)
  - 🌙 **Dinner** (Indigo)
  - 🏨 **Hotel** (Gray)

### Flexibility
Places appear in the **order you add them**, allowing natural daily flow:
- Start with breakfast
- Add visits/attractions
- Insert prayer times when needed
- Add lunch
- Continue with more visits
- Add prayer again
- Add dinner
- End with hotel
